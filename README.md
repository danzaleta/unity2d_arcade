# unity2d_arcade

## Description
This game is an own implementation of the renowned Flappy Bird.

## How to play?
Press SpaceBar to jump and collect points while avoiding brick walls! The more alienated you are with the stars, the more sparkles they will emit.

## Implementation
For this project I have decided to use Singleton design patterns to create globally accessible manager and a proprietary implementation of the pattern factory to manage spawn of brick walls.
